Due to API rate limits, the server has to use a heuristic to assess whether it should try to process a given event.<br /><br />Therefore, if the grand finals* set of an event has stage and character data, all games from the rest of the tournament are processed and recorded if they contain stage data. Otherwise, it is assumed no sets in the tournament have stage data and none are processed.<br /><br />All tournaments since the launch of Ultimate have been processed at this time.<br /><br /><span style='font-size: 0.8em'>* Some event formats (like round robin) are processed even though they don't contain a grand finals set. To be precise, ultimatestagedata.com processes an event if and only if the first set of the event, when ordered by start.gg's <code>MAGIC</code> sort, contains stage and character data. This corresponds to grand finals in most cases.</span>"

These games are recorded and contribute to overall game counts, but are not displayed on a card on character or matchup pages. These statistics are negligible compared to the displayed stages."
