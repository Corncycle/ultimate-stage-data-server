# ultimate-stage-data-server

This project is intended to serve a web application giving tournament statistics of character win rates on stages in Smash  Ultimate. 

Sets will be queried from [start.gg's GraphQL API](https://developer.start.gg/docs/intro) and processed by the server. Data is planned to be updated weekly.
