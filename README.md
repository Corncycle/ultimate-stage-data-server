# ultimate-stage-data-server

This project is intended to serve a web application giving tournament statistics of character win rates on stages in Smash  Ultimate.

Thus far, data collection/processing is a work in process and development on the server has not begun.

Sets are queried from [start.gg's GraphQL API](https://developer.start.gg/docs/intro) and processed by the server. Data is updated on the server-side weekly.
